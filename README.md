### No merge-squash extension

Chrome extension to hide the "Squash & Merge" buttons on GitHub pull requests.

#### How it works?

It hides:

* The green one that by default is the last one you used (so it force you to pick another one).
* The option from the dropdown menu.

##### Before

##### After

#### Configuring the extension

On the options page you can configure the branch to hide the button for. By default, it's `main`.
</br>
It supports regex, so you can hide the button for multiple branches.

#### Installing the extension

* Go to the [extension web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-sm-blocker/aabhjeaepficccegjneggegjjcegnhel) and install it.
* Go to the options page and configure the branch you want to hide the button for.
* You're done!
