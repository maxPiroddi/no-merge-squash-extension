### No merge-squash extension

Chrome extension to hide the "Squash & Merge" buttons on GitHub pull requests.

#### How it works?

It hides:

* The green one that by default is the last one you used.
* The option from the dropdown menu.

##### After

#### Configuring the extension

On the options page you can configure the branch to hide the button for. By default, it's `main`.

It supports regex, so you can hide the button for multiple branches.

#### Installing the extension
